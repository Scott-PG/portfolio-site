        I am an enthusiastic and personable software engineer and lighting
        programmer who is passionate about solving problems and connecting with
        other people. Whether it be the development of user-friendly systems or
        immersive lighting designs, I strive to create interactive experiences
        with real people in mind. I seek the opportunity to work for a
        mission-driven company that believes that collaboration and
        inclusiveness is central to an organizationâ€™s success.

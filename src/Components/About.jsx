        I am an enthusiastic and personable software engineer who enjoys solving
        problems and connecting with other people. Whether it be the development
        of user-friendly systems or immersive lighting designs, I strive to
        create interactive experiences with real people in mind. I seek the
        opportunity to work for a mission-driven company that believes
        collaboration and inclusiveness are central to an organizationâ€™s
        success.
